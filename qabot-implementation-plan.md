# QABot Documentation Implementation Plan

**Project:** QABot Feature Documentation
**Date:** 2025-12-12
**Documentation Structure:** Docusaurus
**Approach:** Dedicated QABot Section (Option 1)

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the implementation of comprehensive technical documentation and tutorials for the QABot feature. QABot automates the creation of realistic and reliable tests and service mocks using traffic replay comparison and automatic Recommendations generation.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Structure Setup

**Deliverables:**
- Create directory structure
- Configure sidebar navigation
- Set up category metadata files

**Conventions (Verified):**
- Top-level label: "QABOT" (all caps, matching existing pattern)
- Subdirectory labels: Title Case (e.g., "Workflow", "Recommendations")
- _category_.json format: Simple {label, position} structure (no generated-index link)
- No "collapsed" property in _category_.json files
- Sidebar placement: Before TRANSFORM section (explicit ordering)

**Tasks:**

1. **Create Directory Structure**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p docs/qabot/{workflow,recommendations,integration,tutorials,reference}
   ```

2. **Create Category Metadata Files**

   File: `docs/qabot/_category_.json`
   ```json
   {
     "label": "QABOT",
     "position": 5
   }
   ```

   File: `docs/qabot/workflow/_category_.json`
   ```json
   {
     "label": "Workflow",
     "position": 2
   }
   ```

   File: `docs/qabot/recommendations/_category_.json`
   ```json
   {
     "label": "Recommendations",
     "position": 3
   }
   ```

   File: `docs/qabot/integration/_category_.json`
   ```json
   {
     "label": "Integration",
     "position": 4
   }
   ```

   File: `docs/qabot/tutorials/_category_.json`
   ```json
   {
     "label": "Tutorials",
     "position": 5
   }
   ```

   File: `docs/qabot/reference/_category_.json`
   ```json
   {
     "label": "Reference",
     "position": 6
   }
   ```

3. **Update Sidebar Configuration**

   File: `sidebars.js` (insert BEFORE TRANSFORM section, after tutorial)
   ```javascript
   {
     type: "category",
     label: "QABOT",
     items: [{ type: "autogenerated", dirName: "qabot" }],
     collapsed: true,
   },
   ```
