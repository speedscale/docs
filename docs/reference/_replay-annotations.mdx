| Annotation                             | Description   |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `replay.speedscale.com/env-id`           | Name of the `TrafficReplay` Custom Resource tied to a replay for this workload |
| `replay.speedscale.com/snapshot-id`      | ID of the Snapshot that is used to recreate traffic. |
| `replay.speedscale.com/testconfig-id`    | ID of the test configuration used to recreate to traffic. (Default: `standard`)|
| `replay.speedscale.com/build-tag`        | Link a unique tag, build hash, etc. to the Speedscale report. That way you can connect the report results to the version of the code that was tested. |
| `replay.speedscale.com/mode`             | Defines how a replay will test the system. Values are `full`, `responder-only`, and `generator-only` (default: `full`). `full` will deploy generators to recreate observed requests, and responders to recreate observed responses. `responder-only` will create an infinitely running replay that responds to requests with observed responses. `generator-only` will recreate obeserved requests to the system under replay. |
| `replay.speedscale.com/timeout`        | Specifies a timeout for a replay. Ignored when replay mode is `responder-only` |
| `replay.speedscale.com/secrets`          | Use this setting to provide a list of secrets for the replay system to load (ex: JWT passwords). |
| `replay.speedscale.com/cleanup`          | Cleans up provisioned resources after a traffic replay. Possible values: `inventory`, `all`, `none` (default: `inventory`). `inventory` will remove objects related to Speedscale's replay of traffic once finished, as well as reverting changes to the workload. `all` removes all replay objects, as well as the system under test. `none` will leave all resources on the system after a test run. |
| `replay.speedscale.com/log-collection`    | Set to `"true"` to collect logs from the system under test (default: false). |
| `replay.speedscale.com/responder-low-data` | Set to "true" to force the responder into a high efficiency/low data output mode. This is ideal for high volume performance tests. |
| `replay.speedscale.com/timeout` | Specifies a timeout for a replay. Ignored when replay mode is `responder-only` |

:::note

The operator will remove all listed replay annotations from the workload during admission review and move them into an associated `TrafficReplay` Custom Resource.
This prevents side effects such as the operator observing and executing the same replay after it has finished.
It also allows subsequent runs of the same replay by applying the same manifests, or incorporating the annotations into a GitOps workflow.
