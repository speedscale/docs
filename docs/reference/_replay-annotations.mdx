### `replay.speedscale.com/env-id`

Name of the `TrafficReplay` Custom Resource tied to a replay for this workload. This value is automatically
assigned by the Speedscale operator.


***


### `replay.speedscale.com/snapshot-id`

ID of the Snapshot that is used to recreate traffic.

* Accepted Values: any valid snapshot UUID


***


### `replay.speedscale.com/testconfig-id`

ID of the test configuration used to recreate to traffic.

* Default: `standard`
* Accepted Values: any valid [test configuration](/reference/configuration)


***


### `replay.speedscale.com/build-tag`

Optional unique tag, build hash, etc. to attach to the Speedscale report. Use this as a way to correlate
Speedscale report results to the version of your code that was tested.


***


### `replay.speedscale.com/mode`

Configure how a traffic replay will test your system by instructing the Speedscale operator to deploy either
generators to recreate observed requests **TO** your application, or responders to recreate observed responses
to requests **FROM** your application, or both. Setting this to `full-replay`, both generators and responders
are deployed, while `generator-only` will only deploy generators. Setting this to `responder-only` will only
responders which will run indefinitely until removed.

* Accepted Values:
  * `full-replay` (default)
  * `generator-only`
  * `responder-only`


***


### `replay.speedscale.com/timeout`

Specifies the maximum amount of time a generator for a replay is allowed to be idle (i.e. fails to send a
heartbeat event) before the Speedscale operator forcibly ends the replay. This does **NOT** enforce a static
timeout for the replay itself. Ignored when replay mode is `responder-only`.

* Default: `20m`
* Accepted Values: a valid duration string according to Go's [ParseDuration()](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) function


***


### `replay.speedscale.com/secrets`

Comma separated list of Kubernetes secrets such as JWT tokens, passwords, etc. to attach as volume mounts to
deployed generators and responders.


***


### `replay.speedscale.com/cleanup`

Configures how the Speedscale operator cleans up provisioned resources after a traffic replay. If set to
`inventory`, the operator removes objects related to Speedscale's replay of traffic, as well as reverts
changes to the <SUT />. If set to `all`, the operator removes all replay objects, as well as the <SUT />. If
set to `none`, the operator will leave all resources on the system after a replay.

* Accepted Values:
  * `inventory` (default)
  * `all`
  * `none`


***


### `replay.speedscale.com/sut-url`

Overrides the <SUT /> URL determinited automatically by the generator when replaying traffic. This is useful
if you have customized your service definition.

* Accepted Values: a valid URL


***


### `replay.speedscale.com/collect-logs`

If set to `true`, the operator will deploy an additional component during a replay that will collect the logs
of the <SUT />. Collected logs will then be available on the report page of the Speedscale UI.

* Accepted Values:
  * `true` (default)
  * `false`


***


### `replay.speedscale.com/generator-low-data`

If set to `true`, the *generator* is forced into a high efficiency/low data output mode in which individual
transaction assertions are disabled and only overall replay aggregates are calculated and reported.

:::tip
This setting is ideal and recommended for high volume performance tests.
:::

* Accepted Values:
  * `true`
  * `false` (default)


***


### `replay.speedscale.com/responder-low-data`

If set to `true`, the *responder* is forced into a high efficiency/low data output mode in which individual
transaction assertions are disabled and only overall replay aggregates are calculated and reported.

:::tip
This setting is ideal and recommended for high volume performance tests.
:::


* Accepted Values:
  * `true`
  * `false` (default)


***


:::caution Important

The operator will remove all listed replay annotations from the workload during admission review and move them
into an associated `TrafficReplay` Custom Resource. This prevents side effects such as the operator observing
and executing the same replay after it has finished. It also allows subsequent runs of the same replay by
applying the same manifests, or incorporating the annotations into a GitOps workflow.
