| Annotation | State | Description | 
| ---------- | ----- | ----------- |
| `replay.speedscale.com/env-id` | **new** | Indicates the name of the `TrafficReplay` Custom Resource tied to a currently running replay for this workload. |
| `test.speedscale.com/cleanup`  | **renamed** |`replay.speedscale.com/cleanup`. Additionally, *possible values are changed* and this is *no longer boolean*. New values are: `inventory`, `all` or `none`. Defaults to `inventory` if annotation is not present. `inventory` instructs the operator to clean up all objects related to Speedscale's replay of traffic once finished (such as ConfigMaps, traffic generators, collectors, responders, and related infrastructure), as well as reverting changes made to the workload. `all` instructs the operator to clean up all objects as well as the workload under test (such as a Deployment, Job, DaemonSet, or StatefulSet). `none` instructs the operator to not do anything with replay resources once a replay is finished. |
| `test.speedscale.com/scenarioid` | **renamed**| `replay.speedscale.com/snapshot-id` |
| `test.speedscale.com/testconfigid` | **renamed** | `replay.speedscale.com/testconfig-id`. This annotation is no longer required. Defaults to `standard` if annotation is not present. |
| `test.speedscale.com/ignore` | **removed** | `operator.speedscale.com/ignore` |
| `test.speedscale.com/tag` | **renamed** | `replay.speedscale.com/build-tag` |
| `test.speedscale.com/secrets` | **renamed** |`replay.speedscale.com/secrets` |
| `test.speedscale.com/jwt` | **removed** | Use `replay.speedscale.com/secrets` |
| `test.speedscale.com/sut` | **removed** | Replaced by `operator.speedscale.com/sut` |
| `test.speedscale.com/sutURL` | **renamed** | `replay.speedscale.com/sut-url` |
| `test.speedscale.com/logCollection` | **renamed** | `replay.speedscale.com/collect-logs` |
| `test.speedscale.com/responderLowData` | **renamed** | `replay.speedscale.com/responder-low-data` |
| `replay.speedscale.com/timeout` | **new** | Specifies a timeout for a replay. Ignored when replay mode is `responder-only` |
| `test.speedscale.com/deployResponder` | **removed** | The new annotation `replay.speedscale.com/mode: responder-only` replaces this annotation |
| `test.speedscale.com/deployGenerator` | **removed** | The new annotation `replay.speedscale.com/mode: generator-only` replaces this annotation |
| `replay.speedscale.com/mode` | **new** | Sets the mode for replaying. Possible values: `full-replay` - instructs the operator to deploy both the generator and responder components and make changes to the workload (such as adding responder host aliases), `responder-only` - deploys on the responder components and makes changes to the workload (such as adding responder host aliases), `generator-only` - deploys on the generator, makes no changes to the workload |

:::note

The operator will remove all listed replay annotations from the workload during admission review and move them into an associated `TrafficReplay` Custom Resource.
This prevents side effects such as the operator observing and executing the same replay after it has finished.
It also allows subsequent runs of the same replay by applying the same manifests, or incorporating the annotations into a GitOps workflow.
