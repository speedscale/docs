# HTTP Cookies

Compare the runtime value to the expected value for HTTP cookies.

This assertion checks the cookies of an HTTP response and checks whether they match the expected value. This process works much like a normal browser cookie jar and is automated.

### Example <a href="#example" id="example"></a>

```javascript
{ 
  "type": "httpResponseCookies" 
}
```

### Configuration <a href="#configuration" id="configuration"></a>
