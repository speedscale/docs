# Asserters

Asserters compare the response received from the application during testing vs. what was recorded in the original [traffic snapshot](../../../analyze/traffic-viewer/view-snapshot).

The Asserters UI provides a fairly comprehensive description of each parameter. For most users that is all you need. However, this subsection is provided for reference when editing JSON configuration directly.
