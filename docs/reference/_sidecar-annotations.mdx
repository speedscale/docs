| ------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `sidecar.speedscale.com/inject`             | Add the sidecar to your: deployment, job, stateful set or daemon set. |
| `sidecar.speedscale.com/remove`             | Remove the sidecar. |
| `sidecar.speedscale.com/status`             | This will be set to "true" by the operator after a successful inject. |
| `sidecar.speedscale.com/debug`              | Put the sidecar into debug mode with additional logging capabilities. |
| `sidecar.speedscale.com/captureMode`        | Sidecar capture mode. Supported values are `proxy` (default), `wasm` or `istio` |
| `sidecar.speedscale.com/captureNodeTraffic` | Configure inbound traffic originating from underlying Kubernetes node on which a pod is running to be routed through the proxy. The default behavior is to ignore inbound Kubernetes node traffic (e.g. readiness and liveness checks).Boolean string `"true"` or `"false"` (default). Only valid if `captureMode` is `proxy` and `proxyType` is `transparent`, ignored otherwise. |
| `sidecar.speedscale.com/proxyType`          | Type of proxy the sidecar should operate as, either `transparent` (default) or `dual`. Only valid if `captureMode` is `proxy`, ignored otherwise. |
| `sidecar.speedscale.com/proxyHost`          | Set the host where you want to forward traffic. Only valid if `captureMode` is `proxy` and `proxyType` is `dual`, ignored otherwise. |
| `sidecar.speedscale.com/proxyPort`          | Set the port where you want to forward traffic. Only valid if `captureMode` is `proxy` and `proxyType` is `dual`, ignored otherwise. |
| `sidecar.speedscale.com/proxyProtocol`      | Set the protocol for the outbound proxy server. Supported values are `tcp:socks` or `tcp:http`. Only valid if `captureMode` is `proxy` and `proxyType` is `dual`, ignored otherwise. |
| `sidecar.speedscale.com/tls`                | Set to "all" to configure TLS interception (see more details below). |
| `sidecar.speedscale.com/tlsinsecret`        | Kubernetes secret with the TLS keys to use for inbound traffic, these keys will be exposed to API clients. |
| `sidecar.speedscale.com/tlsinprivate`       | Filename of the TLS Inbound Private key (default tls.key). |
| `sidecar.speedscale.com/tlsinpublic`        | Filename of the TLS Inbound Public cert (default tls.crt). |
| `sidecar.speedscale.com/tlsmutualsecret`    | Kubernetes secret with the TLS keys to use for outbound Mutual TLS traffic. |
| `sidecar.speedscale.com/tlsmutualprivate`   | Filename of the Mutual TLS Private Key (default tls.key). |
| `sidecar.speedscale.com/tlsmutualpublic`    | Filename of the Mutual TLS Public cert (default tls.crt). |
| `sidecar.speedscale.com/ignoreSrcIPs`       | Comma separated string of source IPv4 addresses or IPv4 CIDR blocks for inbound traffic that should <strong>not</strong> be routed through the proxy. Only valid if `captureMode` is `proxy` and `proxyType` is `transparent`, ignored otherwise. Example: `sidecar.speedscale.com/ignoreSrcIPs: "10.10.0.40,10.200.10.0/24"`|
| `sidecar.speedscale.com/ignoreSrcHosts`     | Comma separated string of source hostnames for inbound traffic that should <strong>not</strong> be routed through the proxy. Only valid if `captureMode` is `proxy` and `proxyType` is `transparent`, ignored otherwise. Wildcards are not currently supported. Example: `sidecar.speedscale.com/ignoreSrcHosts: "example.com,mysvc.internal"`|
| `sidecar.speedscale.com/ignoreDstIPs`       | Comma separated string of destination IPv4 addresses or IPv4 CIDR blocks for outbound traffic that should <strong>not</strong> be routed through the proxy. Only valid if `captureMode` is `proxy` and `proxyType` is `transparent`, ignored otherwise. Wildcards are not currently supported. Example: `sidecar.speedscale.com/ignoreDstIPs: "10.10.0.40,10.200.10.0/24"`|
| `sidecar.speedscale.com/ignoreDstHosts`     | Comma separated string of destination hostnames for outbound traffic that should <strong>not</strong> be routed through the proxy. Only valid if `captureMode` is `proxy` and `proxyType` is `transparent`, ignored otherwise. Wildcards are not currently supported. Example: `sidecar.speedscale.com/ignoreDstHosts: "example.com,mysvc.internal"`|
