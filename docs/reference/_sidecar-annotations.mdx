| ------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `sidecar.speedscale.com/inject`             | Add the sidecar to your: deployment, job, stateful set or daemon set. |
| `sidecar.speedscale.com/insert-init-first`  | Add Speedscale's init container as the first in the list on the target workload. |
| `sidecar.speedscale.com/capture-mode`        | Sidecar capture mode. Supported values are `proxy` (default), `wasm` or `istio` |
| `sidecar.speedscale.com/capture-node-traffic` | Configure inbound traffic originating from underlying Kubernetes node on which a pod is running to be routed through the proxy. The default behavior is to ignore inbound Kubernetes node traffic (e.g. readiness and liveness checks).Boolean string `"true"` or `"false"` (default).

| `sidecar.speedscale.com/proxy-protocol`     | Set the protocol for the outbound proxy. Only valid if `proxy-type` is `reverse` or `http`. Supported values: `http`, `tcp`, `tcp+http`, `tcp+socks` |
| `sidecar.speedscale.com/proxy-host`          | Set the host where you want to forward traffic. Only valid if `capture-mode` is `proxy` |
| `sidecar.speedscale.com/proxy-port`          | Set the port where you want to forward traffic. Only valid if `capture-mode` is `proxy` |
| `sidecar.speedscale.com/proxy-in-port`          | Sets the `PROXY_IN_PORT` environment variable. Only valid if `capture-mode` is `proxy` |
| `sidecar.speedscale.com/proxy-out-port`          | Sets the `PROXY_OUT_PORT` environment variable. Only valid if `capture-mode` is `proxy` |

| `sidecar.speedscale.com/tls-in-secret`        | Kubernetes secret with the TLS keys to use for inbound traffic, these keys will be exposed to API clients. Enables TLS inbound interception (see more details below).|
| `sidecar.speedscale.com/tls-in-private`       | Filename of the TLS Inbound Private key (default tls.key). |
| `sidecar.speedscale.com/tls-in-public`        | Filename of the TLS Inbound Public cert (default tls.crt). |
| `sidecar.speedscale.com/tls-mutual-secret`    | Kubernetes secret with the TLS keys to use for outbound Mutual TLS traffic. |
| `sidecar.speedscale.com/tls-mutual-private`   | Filename of the Mutual TLS Private Key (default tls.key). |
| `sidecar.speedscale.com/tls-mutual-public`    | Filename of the Mutual TLS Public cert (default tls.crt). |
| `sidecar.speedscale.com/ignore-src-ips`       | Comma separated string of source IPv4 addresses or IPv4 CIDR blocks for inbound traffic that should <strong>not</strong> be routed through the proxy. Only valid if `capture-mode` is `proxy` and `proxy-type` is `transparent`, ignored otherwise. Example: `sidecar.speedscale.com/ignore-src-ips: "10.10.0.40,10.200.10.0/24"`|
| `sidecar.speedscale.com/ignore-src-hosts`     | Comma separated string of source hostnames for inbound traffic that should <strong>not</strong> be routed through the proxy. Only valid if `capture-mode` is `proxy` and `proxy-type` is `transparent`, ignored otherwise. Wildcards are not currently supported. Example: `sidecar.speedscale.com/ignore-src-hosts: "example.com,mysvc.internal"`|
| `sidecar.speedscale.com/ignore-dst-ips`       | Comma separated string of destination IPv4 addresses or IPv4 CIDR blocks for outbound traffic that should <strong>not</strong> be routed through the proxy. Only valid if `capture-mode` is `proxy` and `proxy-type` is `transparent`, ignored otherwise. Wildcards are not currently supported. Example: `sidecar.speedscale.com/ignore-dst-ips: "10.10.0.40,10.200.10.0/24"`|
| `sidecar.speedscale.com/ignore-dst-hosts`     | Comma separated string of destination hostnames for outbound traffic that should <strong>not</strong> be routed through the proxy. Only valid if `capture-mode` is `proxy` and `proxy-type` is `transparent`, ignored otherwise. Wildcards are not currently supported. Example: `sidecar.speedscale.com/ignore-dst-hosts: "example.com,mysvc.internal"`|
