# Technology Support

Protocol Support

Speedscale replays involve three distinct steps that are supported separately: **Capture**, **Analyze**, and **Playback**. It is possible to have observability (Capture) into one protocol without necessarily having full replay support. Please reach out if you need support for a technology not in this list.
