# Assertions

Assertions compare the response received from the application during testing to
what the original recorded traffic, viewable in the [traffic
snapshot](../../../analyze/traffic-viewer/view-snapshot).

The assertions UI provides a fairly comprehensive description of each parameter.
For most users that is all you need. However, this subsection is provided for
reference when editing JSON configuration directly.
