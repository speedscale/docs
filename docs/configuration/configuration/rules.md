# Rules

This section allows you to define what a successful test run looks like. If these rules are triggered then the report will fail. If the report fails using the default Speedscale CI integrations, the pipeline may stop. In other words, be careful about being too stringent.

The rules configured in the Speedscale UI are combined in an AND fashion. If any rule failes, the report will fail. The UI contians hints explaining the different metrics.
