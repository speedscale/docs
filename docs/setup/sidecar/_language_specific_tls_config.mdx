:::info
.NET Core uses OpenSSL on Linux and Mac which respects default settings. The default Microsoft .NET Docker base images are Linux based which means these settings apply, however running Windows based workloads may require additional configuration.

<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

Java applications utilize a truststore to specify certificates to be trusted. 

**On desktop:**

Create the keystore with Speedscale certs.

```shell
proxymock certs --jks
```

Then apply these flags when running your app:

```shell
java \
  -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/etc/ssl/speedscale/jks/cacerts.jks \
  -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=changeit \
	-jar app.jar
```

**In cluster:**

During [Operator](/reference/glossary.md#operator) installation a secret called `speedscale-jks` will be created that contains the `speedscale-certs` root CA
along with a standard set of CA certs used by `openjdk`. This secret is automatically mounted when the
`tls-out` setting is configured as shown below. The Java app itself needs to be configured to use this secret
as well which requires configuring your JVM to use the truststore with these settings:

These can be automatically applied by adding to your JVM by setting `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS`. This can be set
on your workload by adding the `sidecar.speedscale.com/tls-java-tool-options: "true"` annotation. Read more
about this setting here.

When running in-cluster, these flags are also surfaced as an environment variable `SPEEDSCALE_JAVA_OPTS` if you need to merge with your own existing sets of Java flags.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: spring-boot-app
  annotations:
    sidecar.speedscale.com/inject: "true"
    sidecar.speedscale.com/tls-out: "true"
    sidecar.speedscale.com/tls-java-tool-options: "true"
```

**If you already have a custom JKS**

Sometimes your code is already using a Custom JKS, so you need to merge your current JKS with the one from Speedscale. In that case what you can do is import the Speedscale TLS cert into your existing JKS. Here is how to do that:

```shell
# 1) Make a copy of your existing keystore
cp custom.jks custom-with-speedscale.jks

# 2) Import Speedscale Root CA into the copy (non-interactive)
keytool -importcert \
  -noprompt \
  -alias speedscale-root \
  -file "$HOME/.speedscale/certs/tls.crt" \
  -keystore custom-with-speedscale.jks \
  -storepass changeit

# 3) Verify the Speedscale cert is present
keytool -list -keystore custom-with-speedscale.jks -storepass changeit | grep -i speedscale

# 4) Use the merged truststore when running your app
java \
  -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=custom-with-speedscale.jks \
  -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=changeit \
  -jar app.jar
```

Notes:
- If your truststore is PKCS12 instead of JKS, add `-storetype pkcs12` to the `keytool` commands.
- If the alias already exists, either choose a different alias (e.g., `-alias speedscale-root-2`) or remove the old one with: `keytool -delete -alias speedscale-root -keystore "$KEYSTORE_OUT" -storepass "$KEYSTORE_PASS"`.
