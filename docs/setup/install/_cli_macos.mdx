Start by installing the Speedscale CLI-based API (`speedctl`) via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```shell
brew install speedscale/tap/speedctl
```

Or via the install script:

```shell
sh -c "$(curl -Lfs https://downloads.speedscale.com/speedctl/install)"
```

:::caution Note
You can inspect the install script to see what it does. Root permission is *not* required to execute this script.
:::

Install a specific version by passing it to the install script:

```shell
sh -c "$(curl -Lfs https://downloads.speedscale.com/speedctl/install)" -s v2.3.86
```

:::tip
To install non interactively (like in CI/CD) set the `SPEEDSCALE_API_KEY` environment variable to your [API key](/quick-start#retrieve-your-api-key)
:::

Optionally skip the install script and install manually:

```shell
# Download speedctl binary on your machine
curl "https://downloads.speedscale.com/speedctl/speedctl-darwin-$(case $(uname -m) in x86_64) echo 'amd64';; arm | arm64 | aarch64) echo 'arm64';; esac)" -o speedctl

# Create speedscale directory and move the binary to the directory
mkdir ~/.speedscale
mv ./speedctl ~/.speedscale

# Give execute permission to the binary
chmod +x ~/.speedscale/speedctl
```

:::warning Reminder
Don't forget to add `speedctl` to your `$PATH` variable in your shell's rcfile:

```shell
# substitute your shell's rcfile
echo "export PATH=\$PATH:$HOME/.speedscale" >> ~/.zshrc
```
