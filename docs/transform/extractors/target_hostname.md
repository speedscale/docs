# target_hostname

### Purpose

**target_hostname** extracts the target hostname, the URL host not including the port, from the RRPair.  Extracting the target host can be used to change the URL of a request during replay.  Note, this is distinct from the host header which may be different than the target host and can be extracted through the [http_req_header extractor](./http_req_header.md).

The target hostname value does not include the port.  Modify the port with the [target_port extractor](./target_port.md).

### Usage

```json
"type": "target_hostname"
```

### Example

```json
"type": "target_hostname",
```
