Install the `speedctl` via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```shell
brew install speedscale/tap/speedctl
```

That's all you need.

However, if you don't use Homebrew you can use the install script:

```shell
sh -c "$(curl -Lfs https://downloads.speedscale.com/speedctl/install)"
```

:::tip

To install non interactively (like in CI/CD) set the `SPEEDSCALE_API_KEY` environment variable.

:::

If you need to Install a specific version, you can do so by passing it to the install script:

```shell
sh -c "$(curl -Lfs https://downloads.speedscale.com/speedctl/install)" -s v1.4.63
```

If you would rather take the steps manually to know what's going on, you can run the following:

```shell
# Download speedctl binary on your machine
curl "https://downloads.speedscale.com/speedctl/speedctl-$(case $(uname -s) in  Darwin)   echo 'darwin' ;; Linux) echo 'linux';; esac)-$(case $(uname -m) in x86_64) echo 'amd64';; arm | arm64 | aarch64) echo 'arm64';; esac)" -o speedctl

# Create speedscale directory and move the binary to the directory
mkdir ~/.speedscale
mv ./speedctl ~/.speedscale

# Give execute permission to the binary
chmod +x ~/.speedscale/speedctl

# Add the Speedscale path to your PATH, change bashrc based on your Shell
echo "export PATH=\$PATH:$HOME/.speedscale" >> ~/.bashrc

```
