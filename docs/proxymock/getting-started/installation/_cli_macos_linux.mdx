Install the cli via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```shell
brew install speedscale/tap/proxymock
```

That's all you need. You can stop reading now.

Ok, you didn't stop reading so here are some manual instructions if you don't use Homebrew:

```shell
sh -c "$(curl -Lfs https://downloads.speedscale.com/proxymock/install-proxymock)"
```

You can inspect the install script to see what it does.

:::tip
To install non interactively (like in CI/CD) set the `SPEEDSCALE_API_KEY` environment variable. This is an [Enterprise feature](https://docs.speedscale.com/quick-start/).
:::

If you need to Install a specific version, you can do so by passing it to the install script:

```shell
sh -c "$(curl -Lfs https://downloads.speedscale.com/proxymock/install-proxymock)" -s v2.3.267
```
