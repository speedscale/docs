`proxymock` can be easily installed via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```shell
brew install speedscale/tap/proxymock
```

Or via the install script:

```shell
sh -c "$(curl -Lfs https://downloads.speedscale.com/proxymock/install-proxymock)"
```

:::caution Note
You can inspect the install script to see what it does. Root permission is *not* required to execute this script.

If you need to Install a specific version, you can do so by passing it to the install script:

```shell
sh -c "$(curl -Lfs https://downloads.speedscale.com/proxymock/install-proxymock)" -s v2.3.267
```

Optionally skip the install script and install manually:

```shell
# Download proxymock binary on your machine
curl "https://downloads.speedscale.com/proxymock/proxymock-darwin-$(case $(uname -m) in x86_64) echo 'amd64';; arm | arm64 | aarch64) echo 'arm64';; esac)" -o proxymock

# Create speedscale directory and move the binary to the directory
mkdir ~/.speedscale
mv ./proxymock ~/.speedscale

# Give execute permission to the binary
chmod +x ~/.speedscale/proxymock
```

:::warning Reminder
Don't forget to add `proxymock` to your `$PATH` variable in your shell's rcfile:

```shell
# substitute your shell's rcfile
echo "export PATH=\$PATH:$HOME/.speedscale" >> ~/.zshrc
```
