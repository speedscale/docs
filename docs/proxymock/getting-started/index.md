# Getting Started

This section will guide you through the installation and usage of **Speedscale proxymock**. Proxymock is a free to use extension that will record a live application's behavior and generate mock servers and tests. This extension is free to use for local development. No strings attached.

*Speedscale proxymock* is a simulation engine that lets you run your app as if it were in a live environment even if it is disconnected from the internet. Proxymock records your application's behavior while it runs in the debugger and automatically generates mock servers and tests based on the application's behavior. Just run your app normally and proxymock will listen to all the API and database calls coming into and out of your application. Next time you run your app, you will have the option of running the tests and mock servers generated by proxymock instead of needing a ephemeral or cloud development environment. You don't need to change your endpoints or database connections, proxymock is a passive listener. You don't need to change your code, this process is automated.

If you want to deploy any of these mocks or tests in the cloud, you can sign up for a free account [here](https://speedscale.com/signup) for our enterprise service.

## [Installation](./installation.md) {#installation}

Learn how to install the **proxymock** extension [here](./installation.md).

## [Quickstart](./quickstart.md) {#quickstart}

Get started with **proxymock** by following the [quickstart guide](./quickstart.md). You will learn how to create mocks using a demo application built on top of [AWS DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) and [IP Stack](https://ipstack.com/). IP Stack is very generous with their free tier, but you still need to sign up for an account and are rate limited to 100 requests per day. This guide will show you how to create a realistic mock that sidesteps these limitations.
