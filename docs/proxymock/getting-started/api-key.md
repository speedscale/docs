# API Key

You can get an API key by signing up for a free account at [speedscale.com](https://speedscale.com). This does not require anything more than a name and email address. Speedscale is a techonlogy startup and we're not in the business of selling your information but we do need a unique identifier to enable some functionality.

:::warning
* Don't put your API key in source control. Use a secret manager.
* Don't share your API Key.
* Non-interactive mode (like as part of a CI pipeline) requires Speedscale Enterprise. We know it's a pain, but we gotta eat too.
* If your API key is compromised, you can rotate it [here](https://app.speedscale.com/settings/api-keys).
