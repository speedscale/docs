# Quickstart

Welcome to proxymock!

This guide provides a step-by-step approach to creating a [mock server](/reference/glossary.md#mock-server) and tests for a simple Go application. Choose your preferred workflow below:

## What You'll Learn

Both workflows will teach you how to:

1. **Install proxymock** - Get the tools you need
2. **Record traffic** - Capture real API interactions
3. **Run test transactions** - Exercise your application
4. **View recording results** - Inspect captured traffic
5. **Run mock server and tests** - Use recorded traffic for testing

## Choose Your Workflow

### üñ•Ô∏è Command Line Interface (CLI)
**For software engineers who prefer traditional command-line tools**

Use the proxymock CLI directly from your terminal to record traffic, create mocks, and run tests. This approach gives you full control over each step and is ideal for automation and scripting.

### ü§ñ MCP Workflow (LLM-Driven)
**For developers using AI coding assistants like Cursor, Claude, or GitHub Copilot**

Leverage the power of AI coding assistants with proxymock's MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration. Simply describe what you want to do in natural language, and your LLM will execute the appropriate proxymock commands.
