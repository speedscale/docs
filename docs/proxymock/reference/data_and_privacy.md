# Data and Privacy

We take data security and privacy seriously. **proxymock** is designed to handle
your data responsibly, ensuring that all interactions comply with strict
security and privacy best practices. Traffic captured by **proxymock** will not
be shared with anyone, not even us, unless you explicitly authorize. See the
[license](./license.md) for more detailed information.

# Telemetry

**proxymock** sends telemetry data to Speedscale to help us improve the product and know what features are important. It also contacts the Speedscale API to validate your API key on each run. It does **not** send any information about the specific nature of your traffic (like URLs, ports, content or other sensitive data). If you don't believe us feel free to sniff the traffic (you could do that with **proxymock**) and see for yourself.
