# Bubble Environments

Speedscale is a tool for creating, updating and maintaining Bubble Environments that closely mimic production. This article briefly discusses the differences between staging environments, ephemeral environments and bubble environments. It will make clear that most expensive staging environments can be eliminated with **Bubble Environments** but some unsupported systems still require setup with an Ephemeral Environments tool.

A **staging environment** in the software development lifecycle is a replica of the production environment where final testing occurs before deployment. It mirrors the production setting closely, allowing teams to verify that the software behaves as expected under real-world conditions without impacting actual users. This environment is critical for identifying any last-minute issues, ensuring that the code is stable, compatible, and ready for release. In practice, these environments are extremely expensive to maintain and monitor.

**Ephemeral environments** are temporary, on-demand setups created during the software development lifecycle to replicate production or staging environments for testing, development, or debugging purposes. These environments are spun up automatically and disposed of once their purpose is fulfilled, enabling developers to work in isolated, consistent conditions that mirror real-world scenarios without impacting the main codebase. In theory, this approach accelerates the development process by allowing for parallel testing, reducing conflicts, and ensuring that each code change or feature can be validated in an environment that mimics production settings, ultimately leading to faster and more reliable software releases. Unfortunately, ephemeral environments rarely contain realistic data and are rarely useful for more than simple applications.

**Bubble environments** offer a compelling middle ground, providing developers with the comprehensive testing capabilities of a staging environment while retaining the automation, flexibility, and resource efficiency of ephemeral environments. This makes them ideal for scenarios where you need to test and develop with a full application scope but without the overhead of maintaining a traditional staging environment.

| **Aspect**        | **Ephemeral Developer Environments**                        | **Staging Environments**                           | **Bubble Environments**                         |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**       | Individual development tasks (coding, debugging, unit testing) | Final comprehensive testing before production      | Comprehensive development and integration testing with flexibility |
| **Scope**         | Limited to specific tasks or features                       | Full application/system, mirroring production      | Full application/system with isolated instances |
| **Lifespan**      | Short-lived, created on demand                              | Semi-permanent, maintained throughout project      | Short-lived but extendable as needed            |
| **Automation**    | Highly automated, rapid creation and destruction            | Less automated, more stable with manual oversight  | Fully automated, staging-level scope with customization |
| **Resources**     | Resource-efficient, minimal for specific tasks              | Resource-intensive, similar to production          | Dynamic, resource-efficient with staging scope   |

This table should provide a clear comparison between ephemeral, staging, and bubble environments across key aspects.
