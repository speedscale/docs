# Inner vs Outer Loop

In software engineering, the concepts of the “inner loop” and the “outer loop” represent two distinct cycles within the development process, each focusing on different activities, scopes, and timeframes. Understanding these loops is crucial for optimizing workflows, enhancing productivity, and delivering high-quality software. The Speedscale platform accelerates developer productivity because it simplifies some outer loop tasks enough that they can be treated as inner loop. Speedscale reduces friction by decoupling engineers from infrastructure. On the surface that means reducing the cost of developer environments but at a deeper level it means removing gates from the software development lifecycle and reducing developer frustration. Some documentation already [exists](https://notes.paulswail.com/public/The+inner+and+outer+loops+of+software+development+workflow) describing this but on this page we'll focus on how it pertains to environment replication.

## Inner Loop <a href="#inner" id="inner"></a>

The inner loop refers to the rapid, iterative cycle that individual developers engage in during their daily work. This loop is characterized by activities that occur locally on a developer’s machine and are centered around immediate code development and validation. The primary goal of the inner loop is to enable quick experimentation, feedback, and iteration without the overhead of broader system integration.

Generally speaking, unit testing could be considered inner loop because it does not require any external resources.

## Outer Loop <a href="#outer" id="outer"></a>

The outer loop encompasses the broader cycle of integrating individual contributions into the larger system and delivering the final product to users. This loop involves collaboration among team members and incorporates processes that ensure the software’s quality, stability, and reliability at scale.

An example of an outer loop task would be moving a new build to a staging environment for integration testing.

## Key Differences Between Inner and Outer Loops <a href="#differences" id="differences"></a>

The table below articulates some of the differences between and impacts of inner and outer loop tasks. A simple way of thinking about it is that anything that requires another person, team or resource is outer loop.

| Aspect | Inner Loop                 | Outer Loop |
| ------ | -------------------------- | ---------- |
| Scope  | Individual developer tasks | Team or system-level activities |
| Focus	Code      | development and immediate validation | Integration, delivery, and deployment |
| Activities      | Coding, building, unit testing, debugging | Code reviews, CI/CD, integration testing, deployment |
| Feedback Speed  | Immediate feedback | Slower feedback due to larger scope |
| Frequency	Highly | High, multiple times per hour | Less, aligned with release cycles |
| Tools	IDEs, local | build and test tools | Version control, CI/CD pipelines, deployment and monitoring |
| Collaboration	| Individual work with occasional peer input | High collaboration among team members |
| Impact of Errors | Limited to local environment, less critical | Can affect the entire system, more critical |

## Impact of Speedscale <a href="#speedscale" id="speedscale"></a>

Speedscale lowers the effort level required for the following common development tasks:
* **Cloud infrastructure provisioning** - Cloud instances are expensive and your organization probably runs too many of them according to [DORA](https://cloud.google.com/resources/devops/state-of-devops?hl=en). Large enterprises understandably centralize cloud administration and put up barriers to engineers obtaining cloud resources.  Unfortunately, while those barriers save money they also slow down development. Speedscale gives developers full control and lets them re-use the laptop they already paid for without compromising fidelity.
* **Replicating an issue for debugging** - If you don't have Speedscale then if someone complains about an issue, you're going to spend time figuring out what happened and building a test harness to recreate it. Speedscale captures the payloads and sequence of events for local replay. Instead of the engineer figuring out and replicating the problem with a script, Speedscale just reproduces the requests that caused the problem.
* **Configuring dependencies and test data** - Modern systems, especially Kubernetes-based systems, have lots of dependencies. Apps of any complexity need to be tested with realistic test data and scenarios or the testing has little value. That means the environment needs databases and systems just like production. Remember those databases and dependencies may contain PII as well. Large enterprises have entire teams ([1](https://copyconstruct.medium.com/testing-in-production-the-safe-way-18ca102d0ef1), [2](https://medium.com/@SumedhaHitihamige/unveiling-realistic-traffic-simulation-for-application-load-testing-9f39f4809f4b), [3](https://medium.com/capillary-tech/traffic-simulation-the-useful-way-to-predict-systems-5e5ec644bd7)) dedicated to carefully curate test data, service mocks and test drivers. Speedscale eliminates this entire class of problem by simulating downstream dependencies at the network level without all the infrastructure.
* **Peer reviews/merge requests** - PRs take a lot of time and much of that time goes to making sure existing functionality isn't broken. Speedscale replays real production data with every PR which means engineers can focus on new functionality.

## Conclusion <a href="#conclusion" id="conclusion"></a>

The inner and outer loops in software engineering represent the micro and macro cycles of development, respectively. The inner loop is all about rapid, individual iterations that enable developers to write and validate code efficiently. In contrast, the outer loop focuses on integrating these individual contributions into a cohesive, reliable product delivered to users. Recognizing and optimizing both loops is essential for successful software development, as it balances the need for speed and flexibility with the requirements for quality and stability.
