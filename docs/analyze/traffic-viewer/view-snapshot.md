Digging into the data behind a Traffic Snapshot.

Once you have created the snapshot, Speedscale will fetch the subset of data from the cloud data warehouse and process the traffic. This can take from a few seconds to several minutes for a large snapshot. When it finishes, the UI will update with summary information:

In addition to these details, a Service Map is shown that visually represents the inbound and outbound traffic, and how the replay will be orchestrated.

Congratulations, you have created your first snapshot. Now it's time to replay.
