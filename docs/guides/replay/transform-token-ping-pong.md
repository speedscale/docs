# Transformer Token Ping Pong

A common pattern in restful APIs involves storing an identifier from a response and using it in subsequent requests. We call this the token ping pong.

For this specific example let's imagine we have an application that requests a new ID and then uses that ID in the next call as part of its URL.

#### Objective

Have the generator extract an ID from the JSON response body of one request and re-use as part of the URL in the next call.
