# Modifying Mock Responses

Speedscale mocks are built from observed traffic stored in a Snapshot. At the core, Snapshots are large `raw.jsonl` files that can be edited directly with a little bit of JSON knowledge. Let's walk through the process of modifying the expected response for an existing mock request. It's helpful to have a working understanding of how Speedscale builds service mocks. You can deepen your understanding by reading about the [service mock concept](../../../concepts/service_mocking.md).

## Download Your Snapshot

Take a snapshot of some outbound requests to use as a starting point. For more information on creating a snapshot take a look at our [Quick Start](../../../quick-start.md). Once you've created a snapshot take note of it's ID. You can find this in the URL of your browser or copy to your clipboard by clicking (three dot menu)->Copy Snapshot ID from the Snapshot Summary view.

First thing we want to do is download the snapshot with the command line CLI:

```bash
speedctl pull snapshot {SNAPSHOT_ID}
```

## Edit raw.jsonl

Youâ€™ll want to open the raw file for your snapshot in your favorite editor like VSCode. If you have an editor configured in your terminal you can do this by running:

```bash
speedctl edit {SNAPSHOT_ID}
```

If you don't have an editor configured then you can open the file directly with VSCode (or another text editor) by inserting SNAPSHOT_ID into the folowing command:

```bash
code ~/.speedscale/data/snapshots/{SNAPSHOT_ID}/raw.jsonl
```

Each line in the `raw.jsonl` file represents a single request. Outbound request are turned into service mocks while inbound requests are turned into tests.

Find the request you would like to modify, it will be a single line of JSON that you can edit with your text editor. To help clarify, here is an example raw file opened in Visual Studio Code:

![Visual Studio Raw File](./modify-mocks/vscode-raw.png)

You will want to find the request (or group of requests) you want to edit in this file. The simplest way to do this is to search for the `location` you want to edit (aka Endpoint URI). Once you find the right endpoint you'll want to stay on that line and make edits.

## Select a Request to Modify

Within the line you are editing, find this JSON location `.http.res.bodyBase64`. It's usually near the end. Take care not to edit the request body (`http.req.bodyBase64`) as they appear similar.

Note that the response body is base64 encoded.

## Base64 Encode New Payload

You want to modify the contents of `.http.res.bodyBase64` to match the new data you'd like to return. Because `bodyBase64` accepts binary input you'll need to base64 encode your new data and insert it into the existing location. Let's say you want to replace the existing response payload with `foobar`. To do this we encode the string `foobar` into its base64 representation of `Zm9vYmFy`. You can do this on the command line or using an online tool like [base64encode.org](https://www.base64encode.org/).

Now, insert the new string `Zm9vYmFy` into the `.http.res.bodyBase64` location:

## Upload Snapshot

You're almost there! Make sure to save your modified raw file and re-upload it to Speedscale:

`speedctl push snapshot {SNAPSHOT_ID}`

Speedscale will then re-analyze your outbound transactions, including your modified response payload, and update the service mocks for this snapshot.
