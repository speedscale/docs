title: Working in Docker
---

:::danger
This is not a natively supported workflow. Speedscale works best inside a Kubernetes cluster using the operator and this workaround is subject to change.
:::


### Pre-Requisites

1. [Speedctl is installed](../setup/install/cli.md)
1. Docker with compose.
1. Root CA Certificate and Key (this was tested using the `speedscale-certs` which are installed as part of the Speedscale operator installation)
1. Access to the client application to configure proxy settings and trust certificates.

### Root CA Certificate and Key

If you donâ€™t already have a Root CA Certificate handy, one is always generated when you install the Speedscale operator. This tutorial was created using a keyset from an operator install. To download this you run the following commands:

```bash
kubectl -n speedscale get secret speedscale-certs -o=jsonpath='{.data.tls\.crt}' | base64 --decode > tls.crt
kubectl -n speedscale get secret speedscale-certs -o=jsonpath='{.data.tls\.key}' | base64 --decode > tls.key
```

### Environment Prep

Using the [manifests](#manifests)

- Populate the values inside `config.env` from your `~/.speedscale/config.yaml` file
- Edit `docker-compose.yml` and modify:
    - `volumes` should point to the location where the `tls.key` and `tls.crt` can be found
    - `APP_LABEL` if you want to change the service name that will be shown in the Speedscale Traffic Viewer.
    - `REVERSE_PROXY_{HOST/PORT}` depending on where your app is running. `host.docker.internal` will connect to any service you have running locally with an exposed port.

Bring up the containers using `docker compose up -d` and it should start 2 containers for goproxy and forwarder. The goproxy will capture traffic and send to the forwarder which will push the data to Speedscale cloud. In a larger configuration you can run multiple goproxy sidecar containers against a single forwarder.

Now you have to configure your application to use the socks proxy running on `*:4140` on your server, and you need it to [trust the certificates as well](../setup/sidecar/sidecar-http-proxy.md#configuring-your-application-proxy-server)

You can now run requests against your service through `localhost:4143` instead of the normal port as our goproxy is acting as the entrypoint for the app now.

### Analyze Traffic

![Traffic](./docker/traffic.png)

You should be able to see traffic in the Speedscale UI after a few minutes and now you can using this traffic to [create a snapshot](./creating-a-snapshot.md).

### Replaying traffic

If you've created a snapshot, you can replay it in Docker as well. Take the ID of the snapshot you created (something like `b973b5e2-651f-4a30-8c69-7bd62a678544`) and fill it in the `SCENARIO_ID` variable shown in the [generator snippet](#manifests). You can also change the `TEST_CONFIG_ID` to a [custom config](../reference/configuration/README.md) you may have created. Paste that snippet into your `docker-compose.yaml` file and run `docker compose up -d` again to start the test.

This will generate a report which you can find more details for [here](./reports/README.md).
