# Traffic Transformation

Speedscale provides a sophisticated data transformation system to ensure that traffic replays successfully.

**Before using any custom configuration, attempt a traffic replay with defaults.** The default `standard` configuration works in many cases so most users should skip ahead to the next step.

However, if after performing a test run your application has a very low success rate, or displays other unusual behavior, reach out on the Speedscale Slack [community](http://slack.speedscale.com) or via [email](mailto:support@speedscale.com). We will be happy to walk through your specific use case. The Speedscale team is working on a configuration UI but for now we're happier to do the work for you than to have you stumble through this complex topic. If you're feeling adventurous, you can jump over to [transforms](../../reference/transform-traffic/README.md) to learn more.
