# speedctl

### About

The `speedctl` CLI tool is used to interact with the Speedscale cloud, and requires an active Speedscale subscription.  If you don't have an account with Speedscale the [speedscale CLI tool](speedscale/) is fully free, with a limited set of functionality.

`speedctl` is the Speedscale API.  Use `speedctl` to programmatically get reports, create snapshots, update configs, etc.

### Version

You may want to double check what version you are running, that can be accomplished with the simple `version` command. It will also show when it was compiled so you can decide if you need an update.

```
speedctl version
```

The output looks like this:

```
speedctl version v0.5.5 compiled at 2021-05-13T18:41:31+0000
```

### Update

Here is how to download a new version, it will update the binary in your `~/.speedscale` directory.

```
curl -sL https://downloads.speedscale.com/speedctl/install | bash
```

The output looks like this:

```

### Help

You can figure out what commands are available by adding `--help` to the end of the current command. For example just running help itself will have this kind of output (don't be surprised if yours is different, new features pop up all the time):

```
speedctl --help
```

The output looks like this:

```

```

### Flags

Note that the flags can be used to modify the command that is being sent. Each different command has it's own flags, for example here is how to get more information about the `init` command:

```
speedctl init --help
```

The output looks like this:

```
Initializes speedctl by authorizing your account and downloading your account config.yaml file

Usage:
  speedctl init [flags]

Aliases:
  init, initialize, bootstrap

Flags:
  -f, --force   Force install with default values
  -h, --help    help for init
```

Note that there is just one option which is `--force` which automatically supplies all the defaults if you don't want to answer all the questions from the init command.
